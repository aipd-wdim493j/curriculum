		<h2>Real-Time Node Web Social Sharing App</h2>
    <p>Alone or in groups, using the mad skillz you've acquired so far, craft a real-time web app that allows users to share <em>something</em>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I am well aware that I just described nearly every social network in existence. Your job is to create a real-time social web experience with a niche market. Multi-player card game? Yes. Health information exchange? Oh yeah. In-browser, real-time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoshop_contest#Photoshop_tennis">Photoshop Tennis</a>? Absolutely. A Designer's Porfolio? Nope.</li>
      <li>Users should be able to register either using a username and password or via their existing Twitter or Facebook accounts.</li>
      <li>The data stored in the app should survive through a restart of the Node app (Redis, CouchDB, MySQL, flat-files, whatever).
      <li>When data coming from multiple users is visualized, it should be visualized in real-time (with Socket.IO, Ajax, whatever). This might include graphs of user activity, win/loss leadboards, latest Photoshop Tennis composition, etc.</li>
      <li>Using Express is suggested, but you can use any web app framework that suits you (or none at all).</li>
      <li>The user experience should be well-thought-out, the UI should be well-designed and the JavaScript should be solid.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Schedule</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Week 7 (This Week): Create your groups, generate and idea and tell me what it'll before you leave.</li>
      <li>Week 8: Present your idea to the class, design the user experience and attack the toughest technical problem.</li>
      <li>Week 9: Present progress to Peter. The core features should be functionally complete.</li>
      <li>Week 10: Present your project.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Rubric</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>20% Interaction Design</li>
      <li>30% Code functions properly, is written clearly, has good comments.</li>
      <li>50% Completed the scope of the project, project is of sufficient size and complexity, everything works.</li>
    </ul>
